-----WHAT EACH HEADER MEANS-----
expires: tells you when the response expires and becomes unusable
date: tells us the date and time when the header was created
cache-control: specifies directives for caching mechanisms in requests and responses
etag: tells you the specific version of a resource, this allows caches to be more efficient, saves bandwidth
vary: determines how to match future request headers to decide whether a cached response can be used rather than requesting a fresh one from the origin server
content-type:indicates the media type of the resource
x-content-type-options: marker used by the server to indicate that the MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension) types advertised in the Content-Type headers should not be changed and be followed
x-frame-options: this indicates whether or not a browser should be allowed to render a page in a <frame>, <iframe>, <embed> or <object>
x-xss-protection: feature of Internet Explorer, Chrome and Safari that stops pages from loading when they detect reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
content-length: header indicates the size of the entity-body, in bytes, sent to the recipient
server: tells us the information about the software used by the origin server to handle requests
alt-svc: alternate ways to reach the website
connection: controls whether or not the network connection stays open after the current transaction is finished

Accept: advertises which content types, expressed as MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension) types, the client is able to understand
User-Agent: contains a characteristic string that allows the network protocol peers to identify the application type, operating system, software vendor or software version of the requesting software user agent
